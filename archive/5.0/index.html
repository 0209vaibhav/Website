      <h1>ABOUT ME - <span class="important-text"> I am an Architect and Computational Designer by mind, but a storyteller at heart.</span></h1>
      <p>
        Every line a verse, every space a canvas, every story a path seeking its voice, every problem an opportunity to innovate, every interaction a rhythm in the symphony of design. Through the language of <span class="highlight-text">story, design, and tech</span>, I bring unseen moments to life, weaving meaning into the tangible and the abstract.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I was born with the <span class="highlight-text">ability</span> to design and impact the world around me. My journey began with <span class="highlight-text">architecture</span>, shaping built spaces that define how people live and interact. It expanded into <span class="highlight-text">interior design</span>, crafting environments that enrich everyday experiences, and into <span class="highlight-text">production design</span>, framing cinematic worlds that tell compelling stories. Now, as a <span class="highlight-text">Computational Thinker</span>, I merge design thinking with technology, algorithms, and spatial intelligence.
      </p>      
     
      <p>
        I strive to <span class="highlight-text">discover the narratives woven into people's lives and the world around us</span>, using them to develop interventions that are innovative yet poetic, driven by logic yet filled with soul. I seek to craft designs that make the world more intuitive, meaningful, and connected, ensuring that technology enhances human experience—without losing the beauty, rhythm, and poetry that make life extraordinary.
      </p>

      <span class="important-text">" The world is my stage, and I am the storyteller, weaving poetry into the world through design."</span>
