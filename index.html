                            It empowers users to discover, capture, and engage with the mementos around them during their commutes, turning everyday journeys into moments of exploration, creation, and interaction.
                            MEMENTO serves as an interaction, intersection, and interplay between the city, its people, and their experiences — a platform:

It uses three models—Category Classification, Tag Prediction, and Duration Estimation—trained with supervised learning. Logistic Regression and Random Forests predict categories and multiple tags, while Decision Trees estimate memento durations. This pipeline transforms raw, unstructured data into structured, semantically rich mementos aligned with MEMENTO’s taxonomy. Automating this process ensures greater consistency, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable growth. It bridges urban storytelling and AI, enriching the user experience by embedding contextual intelligence directly into the platform’s curated dataset.</p>

After scraping data, it undergoes preprocessing: text cleaning, feature extraction, and label encoding. Three supervised models are trained—Logistic Regression for categories, Random Forest for multi-label tags, and Decision Tree for estimating duration—using annotated training data. Models are evaluated via cross-validation and updated automatically through cloud-based retraining schedules. API endpoints integrate predictions into the live web app. This structured pipeline not only ensures high-quality metadata tagging but also streamlines the inclusion of public mementos into MEMENTO’s evolving experience ecosystem.</p>

Through agent-based simulations, the project maps the studio as a dynamic digital environment, tracking how users navigate desks, chairs, and paths. It reveals hidden circulation patterns, behavior trends, and spatial inefficiencies to reimagine collaborative workspaces. Real-time simulations generate heatmaps and performance metrics, helping evaluate layout effectiveness. By integrating behavioral insights and spatial AI, the project proposes data-informed spatial interventions that enhance interaction, reduce bottlenecks, and improve flow. Studio-In-Flux makes the invisible legibility of space visible, creating a framework for more responsive, engaging design environments.</p>

Behavioral parameters—like interaction frequency and movement flow—were informed by onsite observations. The simulation engine generated circulation heatmaps and layout efficiency metrics. Spatial analysis tools identified patterns and bottlenecks, enabling iterative refinements to optimize desk and path layouts. The simulation’s results were validated through comparison with real-world studio use. Performance indicators included interaction density, circulation smoothness, and space utilization.

                        <p class="project-description">The Urban Fringe explores the delicate spatial boundary between public sidewalks and private dining spaces in urban environments. Through close observation and mapping, the project reveals how restaurant seating encroaches into public space, shaping pedestrian behavior, access, and social interaction. This threshold, often overlooked, becomes a stage for informal urban life—where city dwellers negotiate visibility, proximity, and comfort. By documenting how physical and social boundaries blur, the project advocates for thoughtful design interventions that support both economic vitality and public vibrancy. It reframes the sidewalk not just as passage, but as a shared space for community interaction and urban expression.</p>

Spatial mapping captured boundaries, furniture placement, and pedestrian flow patterns. Environmental analysis recorded microclimate factors like shade, sunlight, and exposure. Data visualization techniques illustrated the overlapping claims of public and private zones. Urban surveys and interviews with pedestrians and business owners uncovered lived experiences and frictions in shared space. These insights informed speculative design strategies for balancing commercial activity with public life—redefining the edge between movement and pause, commerce and commons. The methods blend qualitative and quantitative research to unpack urban sidewalk ecologies.</p>

In contrast, “Odyssey” proposes a speculative reimagination of commutes as immersive explorations. By blending AI-driven personalization with spatial computing, it encourages users to engage more deeply with their surroundings. Streets become interactive landscapes—alive with curiosity, memory, and emotion—transforming routine travel into meaningful discovery. Oblivian to Odyssey invites a shift from unaware drifting to intentional, sensory-driven urban experiences.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">The study combined behavioral research and computational methods to analyze urban disengagement. Gaze-tracking devices recorded visual focus during commutes, while mobile apps gathered spatial and interaction data. Prototype development involved AR-based experiences that layered digital prompts across cityscapes. Spatial computing tools enabled contextual responses based on user movement and environment. User testing was conducted with diverse commuters to capture feedback on engagement, clarity, and interaction depth. Insights from these sessions refined design decisions and interaction strategies. This iterative approach, grounded in real-time data and user behavior, supported the creation of an adaptive, responsive commuting experience.

By tracking head position and time spent in each gaze zone, it reveals unconscious habits like persistent downward gazing. The system provides real-time nudges to shift attention outward, reframing the commute as an opportunity for urban engagement. Instead of letting attention drift, Gaze Tracker invites users to reconnect with their surroundings. It transforms passive routines into active awareness, emphasizing that attention is both a trainable habit and a tool for urban discovery—encouraging users to look up, observe, and experience the city intentionally.</p>

A 3x3 visual grid categorizes focus zones in real time, while optimized algorithms ensure smooth mobile performance. Notifications gently prompt users to redirect gaze when prolonged downward focus is detected. The app logs attention data, providing users with feedback on their visual habits. Behavioral analytics track long-term patterns, encouraging awareness shifts over time. All components are designed for minimal intrusiveness and energy use, combining spatial sensing with meaningful interaction. The result is a mobile system that subtly reshapes how users engage with the city around them.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">The project reclaims the disappearing familial fabric within Mumbai's housing culture by challenging the limitations of current redevelopment models. Grounded in the emotional, social, and cultural dynamics of communal living, it explores how architecture can restore kinship, shared routines, and spatial bonding. By understanding familial structures not just as units but as social ecosystems, the proposal reframes housing beyond metrics of density and economy. It introduces a bottom-up housing allocation model—"Form Follows Preference"—allowing residents to co-author their living conditions. This vision integrates modularity, adaptability, and collective identity to redefine housing as a framework of belonging, not just built form.</p>

The process included household interviews, socio-spatial analysis, site documentation, and critical review of state-led schemes. Form generation evolved from analog sketching to algorithmic modeling using Rhino and Grasshopper for geometry and preference-based permutations. Revit and BIM workflows structured the detailing across masterplan, building, and unit scales. A new allocation model was developed using customizable prefab housing modules, integrated with social, structural, and behavioral parameters to ensure participatory and culturally sensitive outcomes.</p>

The concept stems from three arms enclosing the field—each designated for different programmatic needs like team spaces, sports courts, and F&B. A continuous ramp winds through the form, creating a dynamic relationship between movement, form, and spectatorship. The architecture seeks to blend structure, circulation, and function to craft a spatial identity that's athletic yet civic. The undulating bands wrapping the mass are not just aesthetic—they embed light, movement, and program, turning the building into a symbol of sporting dynamism.</p>

Terracing and sectional fluidity were iteratively tested through both plan and 3D model. Hundreds of ramp and façade variations were prototyped to refine material, structure, and light behaviour. Spatial continuity between inside and out was key—final designs balanced technical constraints with design intent, ensuring seamless transitions, visual hierarchy, and a powerful architectural identity rooted in motion.</p>

This contextual understanding shaped the framing of the core intervention problem. The master site was then analyzed to extract an intervention zone tailored for four distinct target groups. Programmatic zoning followed, organizing public spaces and ground-level interactions. Massing strategies were developed based on occupancy data and temporal usage. Each user group's needs were mapped to craft individualized housing typologies. The final resolution emerged through iterative testing—using mapping, modeling, and spatial simulations—to achieve a sensitive, inclusive housing ecosystem.</p>

Designed for Dalmia Polypro PET Recycling Plant, it introduces a courtyard centered layout with stepped terraces that enhance light, ventilation, and interaction. The project departs from enclosed office blocks by creating visual and spatial openness through inward-facing programs. Its locally sourced, computationally crafted brick façade integrates insulation, ventilation, and identity, resulting in a monolithic yet human-scaled presence. The building becomes a functional oasis within the factory campus—bridging utility and expression—while positioning sustainability, contextual sensitivity, and corporate comfort as equal architectural priorities.</p>

Using Rhino and Grasshopper, the team iteratively modelled massing blocks and explored program stacking, façade modulation, and corbel profiles. Parametric workflows were employed to generate responsive façade geometries that adapt to room types and orientations. Each opening, corbel, and terrace was computationally derived to optimize daylighting, ventilation, and visual connections. Construction drawings were meticulously detailed to translate algorithmic logic into brick modules. The final outcome balances computational precision with vernacular expression, allowing the building to be both digitally conceived and contextually grounded.</p>

Strategically placed programs like security, guest waiting, health center, and crèche alternate with green courtyards, creating moments of pause, ventilation, and daylight. These voids not only improve thermal comfort but also encourage interaction and visual permeability. The design responds to its industrial context with a rugged material palette and minimal visibility from the street while expressing lightness and softness within, setting a sensitive threshold for both workers and visitors.</p>

Spatial planning evolved through sectional studies and 3D modelling in Rhino, focusing on inserting courtyards between function-specific blocks. Load-bearing masonry walls and light roof sections were optimized for daylight using splayed opening simulations. Passive cooling, material tactility, and seamless circulation were key drivers. Grasshopper was used to refine arch geometries and window splay angles, ensuring natural light without compromising privacy. Each decision was grounded in the material character of stone, brick, and steel—balancing robustness with spatial delicacy.</p>

Surrounded by factory sheds and located at a vehicular junction, the intervention avoids visual confrontation by adopting a low-key, monolithic exterior while opening internally to light, ventilation, and social exchange. Carved niches, skewed apertures, and skylit wells shape an inward-looking experience. This threshold between outdoors and indoors becomes a soft space for pause, community, and nourishment—filtered from the harshness of the surrounding powerplant but still very much grounded in its reality.</p>

Skewed apertures and carved voids were modeled parametrically to optimize daylight and airflow while preserving visual privacy.

A micro-grid layout enables adaptability, allowing families to customize spatial arrangements based on their evolving needs, lifestyles, and household size. The system is democratic and participatory—responding to both physical constraints and personal desires. Rather than adapting to a pre-designed house, the house adapts to the user. By empowering inhabitants with spatial agency, the model offers a sustainable and scalable strategy for family-specific, community-driven housing that remains open-ended and expandable across time.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">The process began with iterative component development using 3D modeling tools to identify structurally stable and transformable modules. A T-shaped discrete unit was optimized for stacking, rotation, and spatial flexibility. Grasshopper was used for parametric customization, Rhino for 3D documentation, and rendering tools for joinery visualization. Modules were tested for compatibility, orientation, and wall-to-wall connection logic. Fenestration systems, ventilation devices, and privacy screens were designed as interchangeable structural inserts. The workflow emphasized precision, modular logic, joinery design, and community adaptability—making the entire construction system replicable, easy to assemble, and cost-efficient for participatory housing solutions.</p>

The design reimagines a classic gable roof form—distorted as if shaped by wind and context—to create a dynamic, asymmetrical timber canopy. This intervention transforms a small parking bay into a shaded pavilion that filters light, preserves views, and evokes a modern yet nostalgic identity. Alternating wooden box sections generate transparency, ventilation, and visual rhythm, while the LOKAL cut-out at the front frames its identity. It's a warm blend of craft, geometry, and contextual storytelling.</p>

We studied solar angles and shadow behavior to optimize filtered light and natural ventilation through alternating wooden members. The form was crafted for modular fabrication, using structural wood joinery to create a monolithic assembly. The open skeletal framework not only offers visual permeability but also frames the New York skyline from every seat. The design blends digital form-finding with tactile material expression to create a contextual yet iconic urban intervention.</p>

Programmatic blocks were spatially arranged to respond to views, movement, and social overlap. Parametric elements—including bamboo screens, brick perforated walls, and pod facades—were scripted using Grasshopper to achieve optimized, culturally grounded geometries. The warping roof, generated through algorithmic design, stitched together all zones under one expressive form. It not only unified the blocks visually but also responded to each function, creating varying heights, light conditions, and spatial dynamics that enhanced the identity and experiential quality of the intervention.</p>

Divided into four traditional communities called Khels, the village reveals its heritage through seemingly mundane artifacts present in households. Each student group studied one Khel, tracing objects across domestic and community spaces to uncover their material histories, ritual uses, and symbolic meanings. These artifacts—whether ceremonial, utilitarian, or crafted—became entry points into understanding the institutional structures and evolving narratives of Kohima. Through observation, interviews, and spatial mapping, the study builds a layered portrait of how identities are sustained and transformed through objects in space.</p>

Students engaged in object-based mapping, selecting everyday or ceremonial items from village homes and tracing their life cycles—how they are made, used, stored, and remembered. These object trajectories revealed networks of institutions—family, religion, craft, and governance. Tools included spatial mapping at multiple geographic scales, ethnographic interviews, typological diagrams, and narrative sketches. A sequence of diagrams was created to trace the village's location and internal divisions (Khels), document the chosen objects, and visualize the institutions and practices they connect to, offering a spatialized anthropology of material identity.</p>

Instead of typical repetitive towers, the design explores staggering, terracing, and spatial porosity to replicate the interactive and clustered nature of village life. Inspired by rural homes and courtyards, the architecture encourages community interaction, cross-ventilation, and personal outdoor space at vertical heights. This approach blends the intimacy of ground-level village dynamics with the efficiency of vertical construction, creating a socially sustainable and context-sensitive housing model that balances density, diversity, and a sense of belonging.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">A modular design framework guided the formation of ten housing typologies, distributed across a staggered massing system. Computational tools such as Rhino and Grasshopper were used to explore solar studies, natural ventilation, and massing strategies. Parametric iterations helped test visual and climatic performance while optimizing daylight and airflow through internal courtyards and stepped terraces. Detailed spatial diagrams and sectional studies enabled mapping of public-private transitions, shared corridors, and structural grids. These tools, coupled with climate-responsive thinking and participatory housing principles, enabled the project to merge architectural logic with ecological comfort and social coherence at the scale of a vertical community.</p>

The project is a spatial protest and a revival strategy, reflecting on the slow disappearance of artisanship due to urban pressures, loss of livelihood, and policy neglect. Through an architectural cooperative, the project offers dignity, visibility, and ownership to craftspeople. Designed as a hybrid of production, learning, and gathering, it sustains the workers' agency and builds resilience. The brutalist roof form embodies their strength, while open studio typologies echo the informal yet rigorous nature of their practice.</p>

Each team recorded spatial and structural details—floor plans, ceiling plans, sections, and 3D isometric drawings. Careful attention was paid to joinery techniques, material articulation, façade language, and contextual relationships with adjacent buildings. Street elevations captured the urban rhythm and transitions across typologies. Students also mapped the city's historical development to situate each structure within a broader temporal and urban narrative. The resulting work blends architectural accuracy with anthropological sensitivity—creating a comprehensive visual archive of a town shaped by time, trade, and cultural convergence.</p>

The dwelling's conical roof and buoyant bamboo base are designed to adapt to rising water levels, enabling vertical displacement during floods. Organized into two blocks—work and living—the modular system supports flexible expansion. The structure integrates local and recycled materials like bamboo, rattan, golpatta leaves, and plastic barrels, combining traditional knowledge with climatic responsiveness. This hybrid system ensures not only structural stability but also social sustainability through communal courtyards, adaptable interiors, and resource-sharing spaces.</p>

The project proposes an architectural intervention that reconnects fragmented pols by reviving cultural practices and reinterpreting traditional forms. 'Sangam'—meaning union—guides the concept: blending the social spirit of shared Bohra meals, the gully as connective tissue, and adaptive reuse of vernacular roof patterns and brick facades. Rather than imposing blocks, the design begins with the roof, allowing spatial play and cultural continuity. The result is a woven network of old and new, spatially and socially stitching the past into the present.</p>

Otlas and shaded walkways extend the communal spirit, while lifted structures reinstate public passage. Contextual analysis of materiality, typology, and circulation patterns informed the integration of modern design without losing cultural essence.

Through historical timelines and typological analysis, students uncovered how trade, migration, and religious identity shaped a distinct built language—merging local craftsmanship with colonial influences. Each structure selected reflects a microcosm of Sidhpur's layered past, from narrow pols to merchant mansions. The project goes beyond façade aesthetics to examine how materiality, construction logic, and context inform spatial narratives. This deep-dive into vernacular hybridity helps trace not only architectural shifts, but also the socio-cultural currents embedded in the very bones of the town.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">The project employed precise architectural documentation of eight significant structures within Sidhpur's old city. Each team recorded spatial and structural details—floor plans, ceiling plans, sections, and 3D isometric drawings. Careful attention was paid to joinery techniques, material articulation, façade language, and contextual relationships with adjacent buildings. Street elevations captured the urban rhythm and transitions across typologies. Students also mapped the city's historical development to situate each structure within a broader temporal and urban narrative. The resulting work blends architectural accuracy with anthropological sensitivity—creating a comprehensive visual archive of a town shaped by time, trade, and cultural convergence.

                        <p class="project-description">FLY-MAN-GO is a biomimetic response to wildlife tourism, drawing from the elegance of the Great Egret and Flamingo. The design translates bird-like qualities—feathered rooflines, slender stilt-like supports, and angular silhouettes—into immersive architecture. These observation cabins are not just shelters but sensory extensions of the wetland, allowing filtered light, focused views, and quiet coexistence. Designed for minimal intrusion, the cabins offer multi-level engagement—grounded, raised, and water-bound. Through subtle camouflage and tactility, the architecture dissolves into the landscape, enhancing the user's relationship with nature while honoring the delicate rhythms and visual language of the wild.</p>

                        <p class="project-description">The design evolved through biomimetic analysis, wildlife behavior mapping, and experiential zoning. Inspired by avian anatomy and movement, forms were developed via sketches, physical models, and parametric tools. Detailed site studies and programmatic overlays shaped three cabin typologies across different immersion levels. Structural systems were resolved using profiling techniques for slender, expressive frames. Sustainable material research guided eco-sensitive choices, while spatial sequencing was informed by habitat transitions and wildlife pathways. The use of sectional design thinking, nature-derived form generation, and modular scalability ensured a dynamic, responsive architectural language integrated into both the natural terrain and the visitor's journey.</p>

The dwelling's conical roof and buoyant bamboo base are designed to adapt to rising water levels, enabling vertical displacement during floods. Organized into two blocks—work and living—the modular system supports flexible expansion. The structure integrates local and recycled materials like bamboo, rattan, golpatta leaves, and plastic barrels, combining traditional knowledge with climatic responsiveness. This hybrid system ensures not only structural stability but also social sustainability through communal courtyards, adaptable interiors, and resource-sharing spaces.</p>

These were interpreted into thread-filled wireframe cubes that acted as modular tension elements. Once composed, the unified form was reinforced with PVC tubes, custom laser-cut discs, and stitched fabric membranes. Rhino 3D was used to model the entire structure digitally, translating it into fabrication files. The team used laser cutting and 3D printing for precision components, while tension cloth was hand-stitched on-site. The final structure stood as a physical testament to pneumatic principles, built at 1:5 scale.</p>
